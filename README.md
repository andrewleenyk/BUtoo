# Title: BUSpeaks

A place for people to discuss sexual assault stories anonymously

BUAnonymous/BU Speaks

Description: This website will be a place to voice your story of sexual assault at BU anonymously. The home page will display the stories with the date of each response shown below. There will be a nav bar with a header to write a story, sign a petition, learn about why the website exists, prevention, and recovery resources. There is also a resource page on every page if support/help is needed.

SWOT Analysis:

- Threats: Handling spam responses or sensitive/private info. Risking anonymity from user story.
