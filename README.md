# [BUtoo](https://frosty-mclean-856a02.netlify.app/)

A place for students at Boston University to share their sexual assault stories anonymously

Description: This website will be a place to voice your story of sexual assault at BU anonymously. The home page will display the stories with the date of each response shown below. There will be a nav bar with a header to write a story, sign a petition, learn about the mission statement, prevention, and recovery resources.

SWOT Analysis:

- Strengths: Handling data, axis api calls
- Weaknesses: rendering the data, and Route/Links
- Opportunities: Creating an aesthetic website that also has user input functionality.
- Threats: Handling spam responses or sensitive/private info. Risking anonymity from user story.
